## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/B5GkoOPo/labs-24-street-smarts)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Street-Smarts-Automotive-Data-5450e77cf0c44a218a4aa6d67ce889eb)

[UX Design files](https://www.figma.com/file/ecy8WiINQoYzjhkueSwa2a/Street-Smarts%2C-Cornelius?node-id=210%3A0)

StreetSmarts (name might change in production) is a tool to impartially compare the overall cost and emissions during ownership across the spectrum of internal combustion engines to electric vehicles. We make our calculations using the industry standard set by the EPA. Users can search cars by make, model, year and trim package to determine which car is best for their next purchase based on their needs.

### Key Features

- feature one: Allow customer to search for details on a single car
- feature two: Provides more information about enviromental impact of cars than competitors
- feature three: Customer can compare up to 3 vehicles
- feature four: 
- feature five

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React

- It has extensive features and the ability to work with other technologies

#### Ant Design

- This robust library saves time and is easy to manipulate, rather than a different library because it is widely trusted and the UX team preferred it

#### Styled Components

- So that the styling stays within each component to simplify alterations, instead of surrendering that organization if we were to use a different system

#### chart library

- a chart library to render data visually‚Äîwhich my team has yet to select, but we have created a list of viable options

#### Context API

- It reates a light, scalable state management, as opposed to Redux which is more complex and requires more maintenance

#### Front end deployed to AWS Amplify

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/street-smarts-be) built using:

#### Heroku PostgreSQL

- Maintains a robust, relational database

#### NodeJS, Express, and knex

- The industry standard combination of technologies that defines HTTP servers and connects to Postgres databases

#### RESTful API
- It interacts with the server simply and safely

# APIs

## Authentication API here

- We will not be using Authentication

## Payment API here

- We will not be accepting payments on this site

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here **************

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.


# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables ************

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

üö´These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Content Licenses

üö´For all content - images, icons, etc, use this table to document permission of use. Remove the two placeholders and add you content to this table

| Image Filename | Source / Creator | License                                                                      |

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Testing

Using Jest for testing due to familiarity and because it's the default choice for Create React App.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Installation Instructions

Create React App installs several dependencies by default.  We then installed npm using "npm i" along with npm i react-router-dom, axios, styled components, Antd

## Other Scripts

    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
