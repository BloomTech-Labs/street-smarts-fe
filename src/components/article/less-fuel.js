        <h2>Avoid idling your vehicle</h2>
        <p>Turn off your engine when you’re stopped for more than 60 seconds, except when in traffic. The average vehicle with a 3-liter engine wastes 300 milliliters (over 1 cup) of fuel for every 10 minutes it idles.</p>
        
        <h2>Measure your tire pressure every month</h2>
        <p>Driving a vehicle with tires under-inflated by 56 kilopascals (8 pounds per square inch) can increase fuel consumption by up to 4%. It can also reduce the life of your tires by more than 10,000 kilometers. Find the right tire pressure for your vehicle on the tire information placard. It’s usually on the edge of the driver’s door or doorpost.</p>
        
        <h2>Don’t carry unnecessary weight</h2>
        <p>Remove items such as salt, sand and sports equipment from your vehicle. The less it weighs, the less fuel your vehicle will use. The fuel consumption of a mid-size car increases by about 1% for every 25 kilograms of weight it carries.</p>
        
        <h2>Remove roof or bicycle racks</h2>
        <p>Streamline your vehicle by taking off the racks when you’re not using them. Aerodynamic drag can increase fuel consumption by as much as 20% on the highway.</p>

        <h2>Use air conditioning sparingly</h2>
        <p>Air conditioning can increase a vehicle’s fuel consumption by as much as 20%. Open the windows when you’re driving in the city, and use the flow-through ventilation system with the windows up on the highway. If you do use air conditioning, use the re-circulate option. It will minimize the impact.</p>
 
        <h2>Use a fuel consumption display</h2>
        <p>See the impact of the 5 fuel-efficient driving techniques firsthand with the help of a fuel consumption display, a feature now standard on many vehicles. (Some newer vehicles come equipped with even more sophisticated displays that analyze speed variations, shift points for manual transmissions, and driving behaviors such as acceleration and braking times.) Many drivers consume 15% less fuel by acting on the feedback that fuel consumption displays provide.</p>
        
        <h2>Track your fuel consumption</h2>
        <p>How long can you go without filling your tank? Two weeks? A month? Challenge yourself to refill as seldom as possible and your monthly costs will come down.</p>
        
        <h2>Plan ahead</h2>
        <p>Map out your route, especially if it’s long. Listen to traffic reports and avoid accidents, road construction and other trouble spots. Avoid roads that cut through major cities and are dotted with stoplights, intersections and pedestrians. Use four-lane highways when you can.</p>
        
        <h2>Combine trips</h2>
        <p>Longer excursions let your vehicle’s engine warm up to its most fuel-efficient temperature. Run your errands one after the other, and plan your route to avoid backtracking and rush-hour traffic.</p>
        
        <h2>Drive less</h2>
        <p>The best way reduce fuel consumption is to drive less. Walk or bike to your destination to use no fuel and have a healthier lifestyle. Use public transit or join a car or van pool to save fuel and avoid emitting tons of air pollutants a year. Work from home when you can, because every day you telecommute reduces the amount of fuel you use by 20%.</p>
